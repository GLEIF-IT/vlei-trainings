    "This notebook focuses on connecting two independent controllers using the KERIA/Signify architecture. This involves two `SignifyClient` instances, each managing its own AID, establishing contact (node discovery), and then mutually authenticating each to the other using the challenge signing and verification process.

    "As discussed in \"KERIA-Signify Basics\", when a `SignifyClient` connects, it establishes a **Client AID** (which you directly control via the `bran`) and a delegated **Agent AID** (managed by the KERIA agent). For these Agent AIDs to act effectively on behalf of the AIDs we just created (`aidA` and `aidB`), we need to explicitly authorize the Agent AID to act in the `agent` role by assigning an `agent` end role to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `agent` role, in this context, signifies that the KERIA Agent AID associated with `clientA` is authorized to manage/interact on behalf of `aidA`, and similarly for `clientB` and `aidB`. This is a crucial step for enabling the KERIA agent to perform tasks like sending messages through the agent mailbox and responding to OOBI requests for these specific identifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the `client.identifiers().addEndRole()` method to add the role. This method requires:\n",
    "- The alias of the identifier granting the authorization (e.g., `aidAAlias`).\n",
    "- The role to be assigned (e.g., `'agent'`).\n",
    "- The prefix of the AID being authorized for that role. In this case, it's the prefix of the client's own KERIA Agent AID, accessible via `client.agent!.pre`."

    "Successfully resolving an OOBI means you've retrieved and cryptographically verified the KEL of the target AID. This establishes the authenticity and integrity of the AID's key history.\n",
    "\n",

A liveness test is needed to prove that the controllers of each AID are actually in control of each respective AID.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the **Challenge-Response** protocol is critical for establishing authenticated control. It serves as that liveness test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process, as described in the \"Connecting Controllers\" notebook for `kli`, is as follows for each pair (e.g., Alfred challenging Betty):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Generate Challenge**: Alfred (`clientA`) generates a set of unique challenge words.\n",
    "2.  **Send Challenge (Simulated OOB)**: Alfred communicates these words to Betty through an out-of-band channel (e.g., verbally, secure message). This step is crucial to prevent a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) on the main KERI connection from intercepting or altering the challenge. For this notebook, we'll print the words.\n",
    "3.  **Respond to Challenge**: Betty (`clientB`), using `aidB`, signs the exact challenge words received from Alfred. The `respond()` method sends this signed response to Alfred's KERIA agent.\n",
    "4.  **Verify Response**: Alfred (`clientA`) receives the signed response. His KERIA agent verifies that the signature corresponds to `aidB`'s current authoritative keys (from the KEL he resolved earlier) and that the signed message matches the original challenge words. This is an asynchronous operation.\n",
    "5.  **Mark as Responded/Authenticated**: If verification is successful, Alfred (`clientA`) marks the challenge for `aidB` as successfully responded to and authenticated. This updates the contact information for Betty in Alfred's client.\n",

    "<b>üìù SUMMARY</b><hr>\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated the process of connecting two KERIA/Signify controllers, Alfred (<code>clientA</code>) and Betty (<code>clientB</code>):\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li><b>Initial Setup:</b> Each client was initialized, booted its KERIA agent, connected, and created an Autonomic Identifier(<code>aidA</code> for Alfred, <code>aidB</code> for Betty).</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>End Role Assignment:</b> The KERIA Agent AID for each client was authorized with an <code>agent</code> end role for its respective AID (<code>aidA</code> and <code>aidB</code>). This allows the KERIA agent to manage these AIDs, such as serving their KELs via OOBIs. This was done using <code>client.identifiers().addEndRole()</code>.</li>\n",
    "    <li><b>OOBI Generation & Resolution:</b>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Each client generated an OOBI URL for its AID, specifically for the <code>'agent'</code> role, using <code>client.oobis().get(alias, 'agent')</code>. This OOBI points to their KERIA agent's endpoint for that AID.</li>\n",
    "            <li>The OOBIs were (simulated) exchanged out-of-band.</li>\n",
    "            <li>Each client then resolved the other's OOBI using <code>client.oobis().resolve()</code>. This retrieved and cryptographically verified the other's KEL, adding them to their local contact list.</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li><b>Challenge-Response Protocol for Mutual Authentication:</b>\n",
    "        <ul>\n",
    "            <li>Each client generated unique challenge words using <code>client.challenges().generate()</code>.</li>\n",
    "            <li>These words were (conceptually) exchanged out-of-band.</li>\n",
    "            <li><b>Cycle 1 (Betty responds to Alfred):</b>\n",
    "                <ul>\n",
    "                    <li>Betty signed Alfred's challenge words with <code>aidB</code> using <code>clientB.challenges().respond()</code>.</li>\n",
    "                    <li>Alfred verified Betty's signed response against <code>aidB</code>'s known keys using <code>clientA.challenges().verify()</code>.</li>\n",
    "                    <li>Upon successful verification, Alfred marked Betty's contact as authenticated using <code>clientA.challenges().responded()</code>.</li>\n",
    "                </ul>\n",
    "            </li>\n",
    "            <li><b>Cycle 2 (Alfred responds to Betty):</b> The same process was repeated with Alfred responding to Betty's challenge.</li>\n",
    "        </ul>\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "Successful completion of both OOBI resolution and the mutual challenge-response protocol establishes a high degree of trust. Both controllers have verified each other's identity (KEL) and cryptographically confirmed that the other party has active control of their private keys. The <code>challengesAuthenticated</code> flag in their contact lists for each other should now be true.\n",
