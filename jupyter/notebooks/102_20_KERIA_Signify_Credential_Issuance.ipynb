This TEL is a secure, hash-linked log, managed by the Issuer's AID, specifically for being the registry referenced by each ACDC event, both issuance and revocation. The registry itself is identified by a SAID derived from its inception event (`vcp` event type for registry inception). The TEL's history is anchored to the Issuer's Key Event Log, ensuring that all changes to the registry's state are cryptographically secured by the Issuer's controlling keys. This anchoring is achieved by including a digest of the TEL event within an anchor that is included in the data property of a KEL event.\n",

    "This notebook demonstrated how to perform credential issuance using the Issuance and Presentation Exchange (IPEX) protocol.\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><b>Credential Registry:</b> before any credentials may be created for an issuer it must create a credential registry that will be referenced by a set of issued credentials. An issuer may make more than one registry and name them according to purpose.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Schema Definition:</b> every credential must have a schema definition and this schema definition must be loaded into the issuer's local database prior to issuing the credential.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Credential Issuance:</b> an issuer may create a credential targeted towards a particular subject, or an identifier that will be the holder of an ACDC credential. Credentials may also be untargeted.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>Sharing with Holder (subject):</b> following creation an issuer may share the ACDC credential with the subject of the newly created credential, the holder, using an IPEX Grant.</li>\n",
    "<li><b>IPEX action notifications:</b> as a convenience for the users of the IPEX process there are notifications sent of each IPEX action that begin as unread and may be marked as read once a notification receiver has processed the referenced action or event.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "The ACDC credential issuance process with IPEX is a critical part of the overall value that the KERI suite of protocols stands to provide as it is the first step in allowing verifiable, provenanced data sharing between multiple parties. This training shows how to use IPEX to issue and share credentials.\n",
