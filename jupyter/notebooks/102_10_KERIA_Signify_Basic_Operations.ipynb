    "- **url**: The URL of the KERIA agent's Admin Interface. The client uses this for most command and control operations after the initial connection is established.\n",
    "- **bran**: A 21-character, high-entropy string, often referred to as a \"passcode.\" This bran serves as the root salt for deriving the Client AID's signing and rotation keys via a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key algorithm. It is critical to treat the bran as securely as a private key. Losing it means losing control of the Client AID and any identifiers or ACDCs created in the connected KERIA Agent, if any.\n",
    "- **tier**: The security tier for the passcode hashing algorithm. Tier.low, Tier.med, and Tier.high represent different computational costs for deriving keys from the bran. Higher tiers are more resistant to brute-force attacks but require more processing power and time. The high tier is appropriate for any use. The low tier is primarily used for unit testing so that tests will complete quickly.\n",

    "## Adding an Autonomic Identifier (AID)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your Signify client is initialized and connected to the KERIA agent you can create new AIDs and instruct the agent to store key events and key indexes for the new AIDs, called managed AIDs. These AIDs will be controlled by your Client AID (established during the `connect()` phase) through the delegation mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initiating AID Inception\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a new AID occurs locally yet storing its KEL and current key index are asynchronous operations. When you request the KERIA agent to store the inception event and key index of the new AID the agent starts the process and also obtains witness receipts from any witnesses stated in the inception event. The `signify-ts` library handles this asynchronous operation by returning an \"operation\" object in response to creating an AID which you can then use to poll for completion of the inception process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `client.identifiers().create()` method is used to start the inception of a new AID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters Explained:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **aidAlias (string):** This is a human-readable alias that you assign to the AID within your Signify client's local storage. It is used to refer to this AID in subsequent client operations. It is not part of the KERI protocol itself but a convenience label for client-side management.\n",
    "- **inceptionArgs (object):** This object contains the configuration for the new AID:\n",
    "  - **toad (number):** The Threshold of Accountable Duplicity. This is the minimum number of witness receipts the controller (your Client AID via KERIA) requires for this new AID's events to be considered accountable.\n",
    "  - **wits (array of strings):** A list of AID prefixes of the witnesses that this new AID should use. These witnesses must be discoverable by your KERIA agent (e.g., pre-loaded during KERIA's startup or resolved via OOBIs by the client/agent).\n",
    "  - **Other parameters:** not shown for brevity but available, see **[CreateIdentifierArgs](https://weboftrust.github.io/signify-ts/interfaces/CreateIdentiferArgs.html)**"
