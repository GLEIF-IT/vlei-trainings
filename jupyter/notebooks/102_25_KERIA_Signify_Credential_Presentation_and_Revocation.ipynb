    "\n",
    "Knowing issuance and revocation state for ACDC credentials comprises an essential part of some use cases and so propagating revocation state to verifiers, and possibly holders becomes an important workflow. Direct transmission of revocation state is one way of propagating this state between either an issue and a holder, between an issuer and a verifier, or between a holder and a verifier. This direct transmission may be accomplished with an IPEX Grant. Again, for the verifier the IPEX Admit in response to this Grant is optional, yet for the Holder to show the credential as revoked in their KERIA Agent database they must send an IPEX admit."

    "#### Discovering Revocation State\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically the responsibility for discovering revocation state would be stay with the verifier rather than with the issuer. The verifier is usually a subscriber to revocation state of credentials it depends on. The best way to accomplish this is with the equivalent of a Watcher network yet for credentials which, in the case of ACDCs, are called Observers. A verifier would have Observers set up that watch any issuers of credentials it accepts, or any propagation networks such as a global DHT of issuers, KEL state, and ACDC state, so that the verifier can be automatically informed of credential state within seconds, or sub-seconds, once an issuer publishes a revocation event.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is shown in this demonstration of the issuer sending revocation state to the verifier is not scalable and is not appropriate for production. It is only suitable for toy or proof of concept projects. A production implementation would use observers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current state of Observers in the KERI ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "A barebones implementation of Observers as a feature of a witness for an issuer exist in the KERI ecosystem in the [keripy](https://github.com/WebOfTrust/keripy) implementation of witnesses. Those witnesses expose a `/query` endpoint for polling the state of an ACDC. An upcoming training shows how to use this functionality and how to incorporate it into a verifier so that using ACDCs and monitoring revocation state is seamless and with as few steps for the user as possible.\n",
